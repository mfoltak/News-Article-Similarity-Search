# News_Article_Similarity_Search

The News Article Search and Summarization project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to provide users with a streamlined way to search for and explore news articles. Leveraging the NewsAPI for fetching current news data and Cohere's embedding capabilities for semantic analysis, the application allows users to enter a search query. It retrieves relevant news articles based on the query and ranks them by their semantic similarity to the query text. Each search result includes the article's title, description, source, and a similarity score indicating how closely it aligns with the user's input. This setup enhances the search experience by ensuring that users receive articles that are not only keyword-matched but also contextually relevant to their interests.

**Must include your own Co-here and News API Key
