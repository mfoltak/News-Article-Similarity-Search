# News_Article_Similarity_Search

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed for searching and discovering relevant news articles. Users can input a search query, and the application retrieves a list of top articles related to that query using the NewsAPI. The retrieved articles are then analyzed for similarity based on their descriptions using Cohere's embedding model. This analysis helps to identify and display articles that are most similar in content to the user's query, enhancing the relevance and usability of the search results. The application offers an interactive interface where users can easily input queries, view top matching articles, and click directly on article titles to read the full content from the original sources. It combines the power of natural language processing techniques with intuitive user interaction to provide a seamless news discovery experience.
